Hi!

I'm Thomas Feuerbach. I made this blog in 2022 to practice web development and use a CMS, then didn't touch it until 2025 for some reason. My intention is to keep it super casual, but I also have my resume on here in case anyone comes looking. That being said, this is mainly for *me* because I like to create things.

I've never written a blog and I'm not really good at talking about myself or signing birthday cards (really any card). I'm still trying to figure out what kind of *voice* I want to write with and what kind of content I'm going to put on here. So to start, I'm just going to list all the things I like to do that I can think of within 30 seconds off the top of my head: playing video games, hanging out with my wife and kid, playing D&D, building things, skiing, scuba diving, sim-racing, skateboarding, playing and watching soccer, traveling, trying new food, and listening to music (favorite bands are The Strokes & Chili Peppers). Anything I come up with after this will be on a new commit some other day.

## Video Games

I've been playing World of Warcraft since 2006 and can safely say it's my favorite game of all time. Their revival of the "vanilla" experience with WoW Classic had me take off work for 3 days, bring my PC to a friend's house, and put in about 55 hours in three days. We only got to level 28, but we were also forming a guild that had 300 members by the end of our marathon and kept an extremely active community thereafter. It was *awesome*. If you played on Deviate Delight and remember the guild &lt;Udder Destruction&gt;, that was all me and my homie. If you know what a Tauren is (we were an all-Tauren guild except for one Undead I accidentally invited and decided to keep), then you know how awesome that name is too. My first game was Mario 64, and I always had a console at the house until I built my first PC my sophomore year of high school. Video games and soccer were my two biggest influences growing up. I used to play Halo competitively at a competition level. I sim race with a team called Vortex Motorsport. We mainly do endurance races, and I've come in 3rd place in the 24 Hours of Le Mans with that team.

## Sports & Motorsports

I love Manchester City and the McLaren F1 team. I love racing. I have a 2008 NC MX-5 I'm building to spec so it can participate under the CMX (Club Spec Miata) division within SCCA.

## Homelab & Tech

I have a homelab at home that acts as a glorified stack of paperweights until I can get a 30-amp circuit configured to my office because my big sim racing rig combined with my gaming PC, 3D printer, workbench, and server rack causes the power to go out in my office and the adjacent room. It's a Proxmox cluster that I host multiple services on for "feuerbach net".

## Work

At work, I'm a data engineer that develops pipelines, tooling, and software for computer vision model development within the context of unmanned aerial systems (UAS). I've also somehow managed to enable myself to work with high-powered computers (HPCs) and big enterprise-grade servers at data centers throughout their lifecycle (generating requirements, procurement, building if needed, installing at the data center, networking, configuring and STIG'ing, and then administrating and preparing them to hand off to 3rd parties who access them to train models for their specific use cases).
