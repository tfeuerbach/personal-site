Hi!

I'm Thomas Feuerbach. I made this blog in 2022 to practice web development and use a CMS, 
then didn't touch it until 2025 for some reason. My intention is to keep it super casual, 
but I also have my resume on here in case anyone comes looking. That being said, 
this is mainly for *me* because I like to create things.

I've never written a blog and I'm not really good at talking about myself or doing things like signing
birthday cards with thoughtful notes. I'm still trying to figure out what kind of *voice* 
I want to write with and what kind of content I'm going to put here. 

To start, I'm just going to list all the things I like to do that I can think of 
within 30 seconds off the top of my head: playing video games, hanging out with my wife 
and kid, playing D&D, building things, pretending to be a SysAdmin on my homelab, skiing, scuba diving, sim-racing, skateboarding, 
playing and watching soccer, traveling, trying new food, and listening to music 
(favorite bands are The Strokes & Chili Peppers).

## Video Games

I've been playing World of Warcraft since 2006 and can safely say it's my favorite game of all time. 
Their revival of the "vanilla" experience with WoW Classic had me take off work for 3 days, 
bring my PC to a friend's house, and put in about 55 hours in three days. We only got to 
level 28, but we were also forming a guild that ultimately had 300 members by the end of our marathon. I'm also 
proud to say it remained extremely active as a community thereafter. It was *awesome*. 

If you played on Deviate Delight and remember the guild &lt;Udder Destruction&gt;, that was 
all me and my homie. If you know what a Tauren is (we were an all-Tauren guild except for 
one Undead I accidentally invited and decided to keep), then you know how awesome that name is too. 

My first game was Mario 64, and I always had a console at the house until I built my first 
PC my sophomore year of high school. Video games and soccer were my two biggest influences 
growing up. I used to play Halo competitively at a amateur/semi-pro level. I sim race with a 
team called Vortex Motorsport. We mainly do endurance races, and I've come in 3rd place 
in the 24 Hours of Le Mans with that team.

## Sports & Motorsports

Not much to say here because I dont' spend my time watching very many sports outside of Soccer and Racing.
I much prefer to play the sport or go view live. I've been to a few races and a few big games and manage to watch them 
on the weekends when I can. For my teams, I support Manchester City and McLaren (shoutout Lando). I have a 2008 NC MX-5 
I'm building to spec so it can participate under the CMX (Club Spec Miata) division 
within SCCA but my efficiency in being able to work on it is slightly hindered at the moment since I'm a new Dad (hype).

## Homelab & Tech

I have a homelab at home that acts as a glorified stack of paperweights until I can get 
a 30-amp circuit configured to my office. My big sim racing rig combined with my 
gaming PC, 3D printer, workbench, the server rack causes the power to go out in my office 
and the adjacent room if I'm running everything. It's a Proxmox cluster that I host multiple services on for 
"feuerbach net" but at the moment I'm just running a few Lenovo mini-PC's, a Dell R220, and some Pi's for game servers.

## Work

At work, I'm a data engineer that develops pipelines, tooling, and software for computer 
vision model development within the context of unmanned aerial systems (UAS). I've also 
somehow managed to enable myself to work with high-powered computers (HPCs) and big 
enterprise-grade servers at data centers throughout their lifecycle (generating requirements, 
procurement, building if needed, installing at the data center, networking, configuring 
and STIG'ing, and then administrating and preparing them to hand off to 3rd parties who 
access them to train models for their specific use cases).
